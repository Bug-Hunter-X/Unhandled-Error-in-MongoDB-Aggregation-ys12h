# Unhandled Error in MongoDB Aggregation

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: the lack of proper error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of an aggregation query without error handling, which can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes if the query fails. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with error handling. 

**Problem:**

Many developers omit error handling in their aggregation pipelines. This is problematic because various issues can ariseâ€”database connectivity problems, invalid field names, malformed aggregation stages, etc.  Without error handling, your application might fail silently or crash without providing any meaningful information for debugging. 

**Solution:**

Always include comprehensive error handling in your MongoDB aggregation operations. The example in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to catch errors gracefully and handle them appropriately (logging the error, returning a default value, etc.). This is crucial for the robustness and reliability of your applications.
